[] modularize everything until it has the following interface:
    [done] initialized as an object
    [/] has an update function which is sent a framebuffer and returns a framebuffer
        framebuffer is 'screen' ?
        [done] takes in framebuffer, and inputs
        [can't] returns framebuffer
    [done] all state is stored in that object
    [done] can be deleted, and all its innards are deleted
    [done] make sure it only takes input from its function args!
    [done] make sure that object has NO SIDE EFFECTS
        other than debug output, of course
        anything that takes 'surface' has the side effect of modifying surface
            this will have to be good enough.
        Also, internally it has a ton of side effects, but that's okay because it's an object and we expect that.
    [done] get rid of magic values
    [] make any functions static that don't need to use the objects data specifically.
    [] The win state needs to be sent out somehow
        Maybe a function is passed into the object, and that function is called on win state?

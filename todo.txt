[] modularize everything until it has the following interface:
    [done] initialized as an object
    [] has an update function which is sent a framebuffer and returns a framebuffer
        framebuffer is 'screen' ?
        [done] takes in framebuffer, and inputs
        [] returns framebuffer
    [] all state is stored in that object
    [] can be deleted, and all its innards are deleted
    [] make sure that object has NO SIDE EFFECTS
        other than debug output, of course
    [] The win state needs to be sent out somehow
        Maybe a function is passed into the object, and that function is called on win state?

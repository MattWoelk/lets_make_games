[] modularize everything until it has the following interface:
    [done] initialized as an object
    [/] has an update function which is sent a framebuffer and returns a framebuffer
        framebuffer is 'screen' ?
        [done] takes in framebuffer, and inputs
        [can't] returns framebuffer
    [done] all state is stored in that object
    [done] can be deleted, and all its innards are deleted
    [] make sure that object has NO SIDE EFFECTS
        other than debug output, of course
    [] make sure it only takes input from its function args!
    [] make any functions static that don't need to use the objects data specifically.
    [] The win state needs to be sent out somehow
        Maybe a function is passed into the object, and that function is called on win state?
